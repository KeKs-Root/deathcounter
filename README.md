Welcome to deathcounter!

This resource simply counts the deaths of each player. You have the ability to kick players if they exceed the maximum amount of deaths which you can also define in the config. 
If needed, you can use the command /resetdeaths ID (optional) to reset the deaths of only one player or of all players.

Give a group the ace permission "command.resetdeaths" to run this command

If you know how to do that you can include a ban system as well!
